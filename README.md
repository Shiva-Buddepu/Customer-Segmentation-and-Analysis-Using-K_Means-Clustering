# Customer Segmentation and Analysis Using K-Means Clustering

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**.  
The goal is to analyze customer behavior and divide customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing patterns.  
Such segmentation enables businesses to design targeted marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Steps to Solve the Problem

### 1. Importing Libraries
The essential Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** are imported to handle data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### 2. Exploration of Data
A preliminary analysis is carried out to understand the dataset â€” identifying data types, null values, outliers, and basic statistics to ensure data quality.

### 3. Data Visualization
Various plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots are used to visualize customer attributes and uncover relationships between variables.

### 4. Clustering Using K-Means
The **K-Means algorithm** is applied to segment customers into different clusters based on their features.  
An **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score** is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

### 5. Selection of Clusters
The best number of clusters is selected after analyzing performance metrics and visualization insights to ensure meaningful segmentation.

### 6. Plotting the Cluster Boundary and Clusters
Clusters are visualized using **2D scatter plots** to observe how customers are grouped.  
Decision boundaries are drawn to distinguish between clusters.

### 7. 3D Plot of Clusters
A **3D visualization** is generated to provide a comprehensive view of cluster distribution and separation in multidimensional space.


##  Results
- Customers are segmented into groups based on behavior and attributes.
- Each cluster represents a distinct group of customers (e.g., high spenders, average buyers, budget-conscious customers).
- The insights can be used for targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and business decision-making.
